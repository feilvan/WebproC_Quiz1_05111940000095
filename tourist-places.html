                There are so many beautiful natural tourist places that you could find in Banyuwangi, but perhaps one of the most well-known is <span>Kawah Ijen</span>. It has blue fire and there are only two places in the world that has it. If you hike at midnight, there is a chance you could see the blue fire.

                Because Banyuwangi is located at southeast Java, you could find so many beaches. But the one you can’t miss out is <span>Pulau Merah</span>. It’s a long white-sand beach and across there is an island (it’s actually a hill but often time the sea level is raising which separate the hill from the land). It’s named “Pulau Merah” because it has red-ish soil color. Local said that in the morning the hill is glowing which made the red soil more visible.
